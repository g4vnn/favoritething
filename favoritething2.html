<p style="color:white;"> My favorite thing is the "Whole Lotta Red" album by Playboi Carti. </p>
<h4 style="color:white;">Information:</h4>
<p style="color:white;"> Whole Lotta Red is American rapper Playboi Carti's second studio album. Interscope Records and ASAP Rocky's AWGE label released it on December 25, 2020.
 The album's production began in late 2018 and will be completed in November 2020. Kanye West, Kid Cudi, and Future make guest appearances on the album's 24 tracks. West executive produced
 the album and also performs on the song "Go2DaMoon." Pi'erre Bourne, Carti's frequent collaborator and producer, as well as Maaly Raw, Wheezy, and F1lthy, among others, handled production.
Music critics gave Whole Lotta Red largely good reviews. The album debuted at the top of the US Billboard 200, collecting 100,000 album-equivalent units, 10,000 of which were direct sales. This would
become Carti's first US #1 album. </p>

<h4 style="color:white;">Background and Release </h4>
<p style="color:white;"> Following the release of Carti's maiden studio album, Die Lit, in August 2018,
 a video of him discussing his upcoming album, titled Whole Lotta Red, appeared.[4] He debuted previously
 unpublished tracks during a performance in Seattle in November.In a March 2019 interview with GQ, Carti
 said that Virgil Abloh will serve as the album's design director.In May 2019, he appeared on "Earfquake," Tyler,
 the Creator's lead song from Igor, with fans praising his "baby voice." Later that month, a song featuring Young Nudy called "Pissy Pamper"
 emerged and quickly became viral on the social media site TikTok. Before being banned, "Pissy Pamper" hit number one on Spotify's US Viral 50.
 Several extra tracks would later emerge on YouTube and SoundCloud, prompting Carti to rebuild the album. In a June 2019 interview with The Fader,
 he disclosed that he began recording Whole Lotta Red around the end of 2018, at DJ Drama's Means Street Studios in Atlanta and at his own house. 
 <br>
 Carti tweeted the cover to "@ Meh" on April 14, 2020, and it was published as a single two days later. Carti's use of the aforementioned "baby voice" was observed in the song.
 Carti was featured on the tune "Pain 1993" from Drake's mixtape, Dark Lane Demo Tapes, in May, which extended his usage of the "baby voice" and became his first top ten hit on
 the US Billboard Hot 100, peaking at number seven.
 <br>
 Following a social media absence, Carti returned on November 23 with fuzzy photographs of himself, confirming that the album had been handed in to his label.The following day,
 he described the record as "alternative" and "psyched out" in a GQ profile. Carti then revealed collaborations with Kanye West, Kid Cudi, Travis Scott, and Future in the days that
 followed.He also targeted Post Malone and Pharrell Williams in his tweets.DJ Akademiks announced on Twitter and during a livestream that the album will be released on Christmas Day
 and executive produced by Kanye West; he says in both the stream and on Twitter that he "nearly sold his soul" to gain this information.
 <hr>
 <h4 style="color:white;"> Composition </h4>
 <p style="color:white;"> Playboi Carti uses his "baby voice" less on Whole Lotta Red, displaying "a unique depth that has developed since the release of Die Lit." Instead,
 as Hypebeast's Nicolaus Li points out, the album has "frenetic vocal styling that... defines Whole Lotta Red."[NPR's Latisha Harris also noticed how Carti swaps in his baby cadences
 for a more aggressive sound while "continuing with his characteristic otherworldly sound. Instead of being a standard lyricist, he plays a playful conductor. His lines bounce between synthy,
 fragmented beats from various artists, demonstrating how at ease he is toeing the line between captivating and repetitious." Pi'erre Bourne, Art Dealer, Outtatown, Star Boy, F1lthy, Juberlee,
 Richie Souf, Maaly Raw, and Wheezy, among others, all of whom help deliver a contemporary trap sound.</p>
